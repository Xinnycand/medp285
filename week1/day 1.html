    <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>My name is <a href="website" target="_blank">Jennifer Zheng</a>, I am in my junior year of college at Hunter College.
        My major is media studies with a focus in emerging media. I chose this major as a result of my desire to take more creative
        classes than strictly studying traditional books or subjects in STEM. Taking more creative and open minded classes will hopefully
        manifest a future and job that allows more freedom and creativity with what I create and work with while still making a living 
        in society. During my free time, I enjoy relaxing and making the most of my time with indulgences like reading, music, dancing, 
        and spending time with friends and loved ones. </p>

    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>

        <p>My work is heavily a form of self-expression. I like to express spurts of energy 
            and inspiration through my work. This is typically done through visual arts or dance 
            as they have been the most consistent forms of art in my life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Being exposed to music at a young age, while also being a sheltered child, had a great 
            impact on this as my energy would be directed towards copying what I saw musically on TV. 
            Watching movies like Spice World and Hairspray has inspired me to take my love for music 
            deeper as I felt drawn to dance and powerful visuals. Many years later, I still feel this 
            admiration for art as it was an easy way for me to express myself when I found it hard to 
            through words.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While my work is mainly a result of bursts of energy, it is also deeply influenced by 
            ideas in society that I find fascinating and wish to explore and share. Learning from 
            different cultures and environments around me has been a great inspiration as I continue 
            to find new ideas to interpret and include in my work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As I was more on the private and shy side as a child, creative expression was a more 
            personal hobby which is why I do not typically direct my work towards a certain audience 
            as I mainly work for my own self-indulgence and enjoyment. However, I have been slowly 
            working towards sharing my work with others, whether that be friends and family or with 
            my professors simply for an assignment.  </p>
