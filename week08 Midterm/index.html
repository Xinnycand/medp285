            <p>Beaches are fascinating natural environments with unique 
                features shaped by coastal processes. They form from 
                sand, pebbles, rocks, and other sediments that have 
                been eroded and transported by waves, tides, and currents. 
                Beaches vary by location and sediment type. Sandy beaches 
                are common along coasts, but there are also pebble beaches, 
                shell beaches, and black sand beaches, which get their color 
                from volcanic minerals. Beaches host a wide variety of life. 
                Intertidal zones are rich in marine species like crabs, 
                shellfish, birds, and insects. Beaches also provide habitats 
                for sea turtles and many migratory bird species.</p>

            <h2><a href="twilight.html">Twilight</a></h2>
           <p>The twilight zone is a part of the ocean where light begins to 
            fade, marking a transition between the bright, sunlit upper ocean 
            and the dark depths. The twilight zone extends from around 200 
            meters (656 feet) to 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the surface. 
            This depth varies slightly with water clarity. The temperature in 
            the twilight zone is much cooler than the sunlight zone above. It 
            ranges from around 5°C (41°F) at its upper boundary to near-freezing 
            at its lower boundary. Many organisms in this zone, including small 
            fish, squid, and zooplankton, migrate to the surface at night to feed, 
            then return to the depths during the day to avoid predators.</p>

            <h2><a href="sunlight.html">Sunlight</a></h2>
            <p>The sunlight zone is the uppermost layer of the ocean that 
                receives direct sunlight. The sunlight zone generally extends 
                from the ocean surface down to about 200 meters (656 feet). 
                Its depth can vary based on water clarity, with clearer waters 
                allowing sunlight to penetrate deeper. The sunlight zone is home 
                to the highest concentration of marine life due to the abundance 
                of food sources. Fish, turtles, jellyfish, dolphins, and a variety 
                of invertebrates thrive here. The sunlight zone is highly affected 
                by human activities, including fishing, pollution, and coastal 
                development. Plastic pollution and oil spills primarily accumulate 
                in this zone, impacting marine life and water quality.</p>

            <h2><a href="midnight.html">Midnight</a></h2>
            <p>The midnight zone is a region of the ocean that lies beyond the 
                reach of sunlight, making it an extremely dark, cold, and 
                high-pressure environment. The midnight zone extends from about 
                1,000 meters (3,280 feet) to 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) below 
                the ocean surface. No sunlight reaches the midnight zone, leaving 
                it in permanent darkness. The only light comes from bioluminescent 
                organisms, which create their own light to hunt, communicate, and 
                avoid predators. Many species in the midnight zone produce 
                bioluminescent light to lure prey, communicate, or evade predators.
                Light-producing organs, called photophores, allow these creatures to 
                create dazzling displays in the dark.</p>

            <h2><a href="abyssal.html">Abyssal</a></h2>
            <p>The abyssal zone, also called the abyssopelagic zone, is one of the 
                deepest parts of the ocean, located beneath the midnight zone. It’s 
                an extreme environment with unique conditions that require incredible 
                adaptations from the creatures that inhabit it. The abyssal zone begins 
                at around 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) and extends down to 6,000 meters 
                (19,685 feet). There is no natural sunlight in the abyssal zone. It 
                exists in complete darkness, making it inhospitable for plants and 
                photosynthetic organisms. Any light seen here comes from bioluminescent 
                organisms. Food is extremely scarce in the abyssal zone. Most life here 
                relies on marine snow (organic particles from upper layers), carcasses 
                of larger animals, or, in certain areas, chemosynthesis near hydrothermal 
                vents.</p>
